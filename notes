When I make the C++ version, I want:

1) the abstract base class will have mostly abstract methods
2) the binarydeque doesn't need validate()
3) the validate and push should be separate calls, and customizable
4) the peek should just loop L^2 unless parallelized to L
5) figure out properties vs attributes

TODO:

fix peek to L^2 without a set
add intrinsics
test for 01010101 until it's slower than deque
test for ([{}]) when nesting factor is low except 1% of the time
benchmark it for less than 92
